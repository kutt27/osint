## Collection Phase

If planning and requirements phase was the most important phase of Intelligence cycle, then the collection phase is the most exciting. The collection phase of the OSINT intelligence cycle is the process of gathering information from publicly available sources. This can be done through a variety of methods.

#### How data collection depend on planning and requirements phase?

The planning and requirements phase of any data collection project is essential to ensuring that the data collected is relevant, accurate, and complete. This phase involves identifying the specific data that needs to be collected, as well as the sources of that data. It's depend on the requirements by the key stakeholder.

First, the plan developed in the planning and requirements phase will determine the specific data that needs to be collected. This will in turn determine the methods that will be used to collect the data. For example, if the plan calls for collecting data from social media, then the data collection phase will involve using social media monitoring tools.

Second, the plan developed in the planning and requirements phase will also determine the sources of data that will be used. This will in turn determine the resources that will be needed for data collection. For example, if the plan calls for collecting data from government databases, then the data collection phase will require access to those databases.

Finally, the plan developed in the planning and requirements phase will also determine the timeline for data collection. This will in turn determine the pace at which the data collection phase will need to be conducted. For example, if the plan calls for collecting data over a period of six months, then the data collection phase will need to be conducted at a steady pace over that period.

Here are some additional tips for ensuring that data collection is dependent on the planning and requirements phase:

- **Be clear about the purpose of the data collection.** What do you hope to achieve by collecting this data?
- **Identify the specific data that needs to be collected.** What information do you need to answer your research questions?
- **Identify the sources of data.** Where will you find the data you need?
- **Develop a plan for data collection.** How will you collect the data?
- **Test the plan.** Make sure the plan is feasible and that you have the resources you need.
- **Be flexible.** Things may not go according to plan, so be prepared to adjust as needed.

#### Law

One law that restricts data collection for OSINT is the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The GDPR is a regulation in the European Union (EU) that was adopted in 2016. It applies to all organizations that process the personal data of EU citizens, regardless of where the organization is located.

The GDPR restricts the collection of personal data without the consent of the individual. It also requires organizations to take steps to protect the personal data they collect. This includes steps to ensure that the data is secure and that it is not used for unauthorized purposes.

The GDPR provides guidance on how to collect data, but it is important to seek legal advice before collecting any data.

### Pivoting

Pivoting in OSINT is the process of using information you have already found to identify new sources of information. For example, if you are investigating a person's online activity, you might find a link to their social media profile. You could then pivot from the social media profile to find other accounts that the person owns, such as a blog or a forum. You could also use the social media profile to find information about the person's friends and family, which could lead you to even more sources of information.

For example:

     Name ------> Social Media, Email, etc.
     Image --------> Location, Address
