OSINT stands for Open-Source Intelligence. It is the process of collecting information from publicly available sources, such as the internet, social media, and government records. OSINT can be used for a variety of purposes, such as:

**Security**: OSINT can be used to identify potential threats, such as cyber attacks or terrorist activity.

**Business intelligence**: OSINT can be used to gather information about competitors, customers, and markets.

**Investigations**: OSINT can be used to gather information about people or events, such as for law enforcement or journalism.

### Passive Method

OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence) is the process of collecting information from publicly available sources, such as the internet, social media, and government records. The information collected through OSINT is **passive**, meaning that it is not gathered through direct interaction with the target. For example, an OSINT analyst might collect information about a company by reading its website, following its employees on social media, and reviewing its financial filings. The analyst would not directly contact the company or its employees to gather this information.

==It is also noted that the collected information should not be used to access the credentials of a person in the database to log in or access anything. This process of accessing is known as active reconnaissance and is typically performed by ethical hackers.==

There are a few reasons why OSINT is considered passive. **First**, it is often more ethical than other forms of intelligence gathering, such as human intelligence (HUMINT) or signals intelligence (SIGINT). HUMINT involves gathering information through direct interaction with people, such as through interviews or surveillance. SIGINT involves gathering information through electronic means, such as through wiretapping or satellite imagery. These methods can be intrusive and violate people's privacy. OSINT, on the other hand, does not involve any direct interaction with people or electronic devices. As a result, it is generally considered to be more ethical.

**Second**, OSINT is often more cost-effective than other forms of intelligence gathering. HUMINT and SIGINT can be expensive, requiring the use of trained personnel and expensive equipment. OSINT, on the other hand, can be done by anyone with access to the internet. As a result, it is often a more cost-effective way to gather intelligence.

**Finally**, OSINT can be more timely than other forms of intelligence gathering. HUMINT and SIGINT can take weeks or even months to gather information. OSINT, on the other hand, can be used to gather information in real time. As a result, it is often a more timely way to gather intelligence.

While OSINT is generally considered to be passive, there are some cases where it can be used to access something. For example, an OSINT analyst might use publicly available information to find a target's email address or phone number. The analyst could then use this information to contact the target and gather more information. However, this would be considered an active use of OSINT.

### Qualities of a Great OSINT Analyst

- **Curiosity:** A great OSINT analyst is always curious and wants to learn more about the world around them. They are always asking questions and seeking out new information.
- **Critical thinking:** A great OSINT analyst is able to think critically about the information they gather. They are able to identify bias, assess credibility, and draw sound conclusions.
- **Research skills:** A great OSINT analyst has strong research skills. They are able to find information from a variety of sources, including the internet, social media, and government records.
- **Data analysis skills:** A great OSINT analyst is able to analyze data and identify patterns. They are able to use this information to make predictions and inform decision-making.
- **Communication skills:** A great OSINT analyst is able to communicate their findings effectively. They are able to write clear and concise reports, and they are able to present their findings to a variety of audiences.
- **Ethics:** A great OSINT analyst is ethical and responsible in their use of information. They respect the privacy of others and they only use information for legitimate purposes.

#### Some example

Websites: Any website that is publicly accessible can be used for OSINT. This includes government websites, social media websites, news websites, and personal websites.

Social media: Social media platforms, such as Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn, are a goldmine of information. Users often share personal information, such as their location, interests, and employment history, on social media.

Government records: Government records, such as court documents, property records, and business licenses, are often publicly available. These records can provide valuable information about people and businesses.

#### Summary

OSINT can be a powerful tool for gathering information. However, it is important to remember that OSINT is not perfect. The information that is gathered from open sources may not be accurate or complete. It is important to cross-check information from multiple sources and to use your own judgment when evaluating the information.
