#### Overview

The history of OSINT can be traced back to the early days of human civilization. In ancient times, people used to gather information about their enemies by listening to rumors, reading public records, and observing their behavior. In the Middle Ages, governments began to collect information about their subjects through a network of spies and informants.

The first formal use of OSINT by a government was by the British during World War I. The British government established the **Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS)** to collect and analyze information from German radio broadcasts. The GC&CS was instrumental in breaking the German Enigma code, which gave the British a significant advantage in the war.

The United States also began to use OSINT during World War II. The US government established the **Foreign Broadcast Intelligence Service (FBIS)** to monitor foreign radio broadcasts. The FBIS was used to gather information about enemy troop movements, military plans, and industrial production.

OSINT continued to be used by governments after World War II. The US government established the **Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)** in 1947. The CIA uses OSINT to gather information about foreign governments, militaries, and economies.

In recent years, the rise of the internet and social media has made it easier for people to gather and share information. This has led to a surge in the use of OSINT by governments, businesses, and individuals.

OSINT can be a valuable tool for governments, businesses, and individuals. However, it is important to note that OSINT is not perfect. OSINT can be inaccurate, incomplete, or misleading. It is important to cross-check OSINT with other sources of information before making any decisions.

One specific event that helped a country through OSINT is the case of the MH17 airliner that was shot down over Ukraine in 2014. The Dutch Safety Board used OSINT, including social media posts, satellite imagery, and radar data, to piece together what happened to the plane. The investigation found that the plane was shot down by a Russian-made Buk missile fired from territory controlled by pro-Russian separatists.

The use of OSINT in this case helped to bring justice to the victims of the MH17 disaster and to hold those responsible accountable. It also highlighted the importance of OSINT as a tool for gathering information and solving crimes.
